todo_list_app
A new Flutter project â€” To-Do List App.

Getting Started
This project is a beginner-friendly to-do list application built using Flutter. It allows users to:

Add new tasks

Mark tasks as completed

View a list of completed tasks

Clear all tasks with a single tap

This is my first app after transitioning from no-code development on Bubble.io to native development with Flutter. It's a clean, minimalistic app designed to practice state management, UI building, and navigation.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

Lab: Write your first Flutter app

Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples

To get started with Flutter development, view the online documentation, which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
